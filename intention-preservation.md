on a practical level, if a sentence reads "an apple a day keeps the doctor away", editor A sees it and wants to change it into "a banana a day keeps the baboons happy" and editor B wants to change it to "apples contain sugar and are not a silver bullet", both edits are dependent on the current state being what it is... maybe editor A would not have made the edit had they known editor B was making a different edit. what is this problem and is there a solution? 

This is the classic **lost update problem** or **write-write conflict** in concurrent editing. It's a fundamental challenge in distributed systems and collaborative editing where multiple agents are modifying shared state simultaneously.

The core issue is that both editors made decisions based on a specific version of the text, but their edits are incompatible. When both changes are applied, one will either overwrite the other (lost update) or create a nonsensical result if naively merged.

## Common Solutions:

**1. Pessimistic Locking**
- Editor A locks the sentence before editing
- Editor B must wait until A releases the lock
- Guarantees consistency but reduces concurrency

**2. Optimistic Concurrency Control**
- Each sentence has a version number
- Editors submit changes with the version they based their edit on
- If versions don't match, the edit is rejected and the editor must retry
- Better for low-conflict scenarios

**3. Operational Transformation (OT)**
- Used by Google Docs
- Transforms operations based on concurrent changes
- In your example, it might try to preserve both intents, though semantic conflicts are hard

**4. Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**
- Data structures that automatically merge concurrent updates
- Would need semantic understanding for your example
- Works well for character-level edits, less so for semantic changes

**5. Three-way Merge**
- Like Git's merge strategy
- Shows: original text, Edit A, Edit B
- Requires human intervention for semantic conflicts

**6. Intention Preservation**
- More experimental approach
- Captures the "why" behind edits
- Editor A: "make it about bananas and humor"
- Editor B: "add health disclaimer"
- System attempts to satisfy both intentions

For your specific example, since the edits are semantically incompatible (completely different meanings), most automated solutions would flag this as a conflict requiring human resolution. The most practical approach would be showing both editors that a conflict occurred and letting them coordinate or choose which edit to keep.
