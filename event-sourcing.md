# Specification: Event-Sourced Reader-Writer Implementation

## Overview

This specification defines an event-sourced approach to the reader-writer problem where state changes are captured as immutable events rather than direct mutations. Readers reconstruct current state from the event stream, while writers append new events.

## Core Concepts

### Traditional Reader-Writer
- Readers acquire shared locks to read mutable state
- Writers acquire exclusive locks to modify state directly
- Contention occurs at the lock level

### Event-Sourced Reader-Writer
- Writers append events to an append-only log (no locking needed)
- Readers reconstruct state from events (no locking needed)
- Contention moves from locks to event ordering

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Event Store**
   - Append-only log of all state changes
   - Guarantees ordering through sequence numbers
   - Supports concurrent appends

2. **Event Types**
   ```
   DataWrittenEvent {
     SequenceNumber: long
     WriterId: int
     Data: string
     Timestamp: DateTime
   }
   
   DataRemovedEvent {
     SequenceNumber: long
     WriterId: int
     ItemId: guid
     Timestamp: DateTime
   }
   ```

3. **Write Operations**
   - Generate appropriate event
   - Append to event store
   - Return immediately (no waiting for locks)

4. **Read Operations**
   - Fetch events from store
   - Apply events in order to build current state
   - Cache reconstructed state with version number

## Implementation Design

### Event Store Interface
```
interface IEventStore {
  Task<long> AppendAsync(Event event)
  Task<IEnumerable<Event>> GetEventsAsync(long fromSequence)
  Task<long> GetLatestSequenceAsync()
}
```

### Writer Process
1. Create event representing the change
2. Call AppendAsync (atomic operation)
3. Event store assigns sequence number
4. Writer completes immediately

### Reader Process
1. Check cached state version
2. If stale, fetch new events since last version
3. Apply new events to cached state
4. Return reconstructed current state

## Consistency Models

### Strong Consistency
- Readers always fetch latest events before reading
- Higher latency but guaranteed latest data
- Similar to acquiring read lock in traditional model

### Eventual Consistency
- Readers use cached state
- Background process updates cache periodically
- Lower latency but possibly stale data

### Bounded Staleness
- Readers use cache if less than N seconds old
- Balance between consistency and performance

## Advantages Over Traditional Locking

1. **No Lock Contention**
   - Writers never block
   - Readers never block
   - Append operations are naturally concurrent

2. **Natural Audit Trail**
   - Every change is recorded
   - Can reconstruct state at any point in time
   - Built-in history for debugging

3. **Horizontal Scalability**
   - Event store can be partitioned
   - Read models can be replicated
   - Cache layers can be distributed

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Event Ordering
- **Problem**: Concurrent appends need ordering
- **Solution**: Event store assigns monotonic sequence numbers

### Challenge: Read Performance
- **Problem**: Reconstructing from thousands of events is slow
- **Solution**: Periodic snapshots + incremental updates

### Challenge: Storage Growth
- **Problem**: Events accumulate indefinitely
- **Solution**: Archive old events, maintain recent window

## Snapshot Strategy

### Snapshot Creation
1. Every N events or T time period
2. Capture full state at sequence S
3. Store snapshot with sequence number

### Read with Snapshots
1. Find latest snapshot before requested time
2. Fetch events after snapshot sequence
3. Apply events to snapshot state

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High Write Throughput
- 1000 writers appending events
- No lock contention
- Event store handles ordering

### Scenario 2: Read-Heavy Workload
- Materialize multiple read models
- Each optimized for specific queries
- Update asynchronously from event stream

### Scenario 3: Time Travel Queries
- "Show me the state as of yesterday 3 PM"
- Simply replay events up to that timestamp
- Impossible with traditional mutable state

## Performance Characteristics

### Write Performance
- O(1) append operation
- No waiting for locks
- Throughput limited by event store

### Read Performance
- O(n) where n = events since last snapshot
- Amortized O(1) with effective caching
- Can scale horizontally with read replicas

## Comparison Matrix

| Aspect | Traditional RW Lock | Event Sourced |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| Write Latency | Variable (lock wait) | Constant (append) |
| Read Latency | Low (direct read) | Higher (reconstruction) |
| Scalability | Vertical | Horizontal |
| History | Not preserved | Complete audit trail |
| Conflict Resolution | Blocking | Natural ordering |
| Complexity | Lower | Higher |

## When to Use Event Sourcing for Reader-Writer

### Good Fit
- Audit requirements
- Need for temporal queries
- High write throughput
- Distributed systems
- Complex domain with many state transitions

### Poor Fit
- Simple CRUD operations
- Extreme low-latency reads required
- Small, simple domain models
- Limited infrastructure expertise

## Migration Path from Traditional to Event-Sourced

1. **Dual Write Phase**
   - Keep existing locked state
   - Also write events
   - Allows rollback if needed

2. **Read Migration**
   - Start reading from events
   - Fall back to locked state if needed
   - Monitor performance

3. **Full Migration**
   - Remove traditional state
   - All operations through events
   - Optimize with snapshots and projections
